## Mutation Score Badge

- The badge above displays the mutation testing score for the project.
- To automate this badge, use a badge service (e.g., shields.io) and update the badge URL with your actual mutation score, or use a GitHub Action to update the badge after each CI run.
- See `.github/workflows/test-scripts.yml` for mutation testing details.
